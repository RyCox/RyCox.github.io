Man, I’m really bad about this. I’m now two months in at my new job consulting for a media company, and I have to say: I’m still really bad at blogging regularly. That’s got to be my mid-year resolution: I have to post at least once a week from here on out. I’m really enjoying my job consulting as a QA Analyst, but I realize that, as a consultant, this job won’t last forever and I need to keep myslef sharp, mentally speaking. So, let’s start today, shall we?

The family and I finally moved out of the hotel on the third, and the new place is a mansion. Honestly, I think our 900 sq ft townhouse would feel like a mansion after two months in a hotel, but I digress. We got everything unpacked and started getting into a routine, which brings me to this point: I have to make good behaviors part of my new routine. Healthy eating can’t be an afterthought; Finishing that blog post or working on the website needs to be a priority. I can’t remember who said it, but it sort of applies to this situation: If you don’t plan for the simple things, they won’t happen. I think he was talking about finances and budgeting for savings rather than just putting whatever was left over at the end of the month away, but time is a lot like money: We only get a set amount per month, and it’s really, REALLY easily wasted. So! Here’s the deal: A weekly post to the blog re: something I learned this week. I can’t promise that it’ll be groundbreaking each time, but I can promise it’ll get done.

If I want to advance in my career, as so many of my colleagues have become indispensable to their own employers and coworkers, I need to take a page from their handbook and really put myself out there as someone who’s in it for the long haul and isn’t afraid of getting their hands dirty or their brain fried (talking about knowledge, here, not some 420 party guys). This blog started out being a way for me to do that, but I haven’t made it a priority in the past. That’s a good place to start the change.
