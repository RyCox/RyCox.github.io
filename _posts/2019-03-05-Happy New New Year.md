_*Howdy!*_

So, this is my first blog post in a long time.  A lot has changed, but at the same time most things are the same.  I'm speaking at Codestock this year, which will be my first presentation outside of small user group meetings.  The topic is RESTful testing practices, both manual and automated.  Anxiety is real, but I know I'll be good to go on the day of.

Technology wise, we're not doing much different than before at work.  We're just doing more of it.  So, I'm going to take any opportunity I have to refocus myself on studying the processes necessary to be efficient and productive at work.  

As someone who is mostly self taught, or learned on the job how to do software testing, I have a large block of things I could feel more comfortable with.  Test case writing, documentation, statistics and data analysis, etc.  So, wish me luck and let's get to it!
