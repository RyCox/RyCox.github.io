# Well, let's try this again.

It's been a long time since I've written anything substantive.  Heck, it's been a long time since I've written anything at all.  So let's give this another go.  

### Status
Kids are growing up, projects are piling up (we bought an Airstream to remodel, and then the truck that we bought to pull the airstream stopped running, so that needs attention, too), and I'm working on an MBA with a focus on Business Analytics.  I've got about six months left with that.  More to come there.

I was recently promoted to TPM II at work, and am focused now on the project and portfolio side of things.  What that means is that I'm still working to get the same dev team their stories, but now I'm working across teams and focused on the whole project, not just what one particular team is involved in.

### Portfolio & Project
The goal here is that instead of being concerned with a single team and triaging everything that comes through their door, I'll be an SME on one particular effort and be able to walk the entire project from end to end with each team involved.

I've got a lot to write about on this change, but that will come in another post.  I think it'll be really good not only for me and my ability to keep up and stop drinking from the fire hose, but also for the teams to have a single point of contact for the project and reduce churn.

Meanwhile, I'm going to post this, welcome you back to my "space", and re-confirm that I'm working to be better and keep growing.
