  <summary>What am I supposed to do with this?

I finished my last Winter, and it was a lot of fun, a lot of long nights studying and wiritng papers.  I came out of it with a renewed sense of purpose and some sweet, sweet validation that I’m not as incompetent as I often see myself (insert jab about Millenial “Gifted” burnout here).

Now, I’ve been in my current role for a minute, but I’m pressing myself ...</summary>

  <summary>Well, let’s try this again.

It’s been a long time since I’ve written anything substantive.  Heck, it’s been a long time since I’ve written anything at all.  So let’s give this another go.

Kids are growing up, projects are piling up (we bought an Airstream to remodel, and then the truck that we bought to pull the airstream stopped running, so that needs attention, too), and I’m working ...</summary>

  <summary>About a year ago…
I took a leap out of the QA Engineering world I’d grown to love and into something new. I decided that the time had come for me to get out of the individual contributor role and into one that would allow me to facilitate teams to produce quality software.  There were various reasons for this, none of which really matter in the grand scheme of things, but the main reason is tha...</summary>

  <summary>Last week was a frustrating week in my life of software testing.

The old Imposter Syndrome hit hard, and for good reason.  There were several times that I ran into a wall testing new functionality in this new service, and had to go back to the developer several times for clarification and to help unstick myself.  One of those times resulted in us delaying the deployment.

It was my fault.  Tot...</summary>

  <summary>Dependency resolution process
I ran into a trippy issue with my tests recently.  I had a null pointer exception given, followed by a no such method error within a JaxB function.  I did my best to make sure I had everything I needed, and the versions that would support the actions I was trying to take, but nothing seemed to resolve and the exceptions were really confusing me (not a difficult tas...</summary>
