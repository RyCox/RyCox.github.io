# Howdy!  

My name's Ryan, and I'm pretty busy these days.  I'm a dad, husband, progam manager, Nerf enthusiast, car guy, and general nerd.  When I'm not working to help teams build unique and valuable tech, I'm probably at a soccer game, running, or wrenching on one of the family cars.  My ADHD keeps me moving, taking things apart to see how they work, fixing old game controllers, and painting the wheels on my car (no joke).

_This blog_ is meant to be a place where I can put to words my experiences in program management, different processes and tools I've learned along the way, and as a documentation of where I've been to help define where I go from here.  I appreciate you taking a moment out of your day to check it out!
